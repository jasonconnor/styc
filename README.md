<h2>Overview: Backend</h2>

<p>
The backend of our web application was developed using the PHP Framework Symfony. Base functionality includes    the ability to register a user, sign into the application, play the game, and finally, submit the dynamically generated game values to the database. The top 100 of these records are displayed on the Highscores page. Additionally, users will be able to view their individual highscores on their Account page, as well as change their password.
